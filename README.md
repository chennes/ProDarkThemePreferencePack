This is a preference pack including GUI color information to extend the ProDark stylesheet.

The [ProDark](https://github.com/turn211/ProDark-FreeCAD-theme) stylesheet is distributed with FreeCAD directly and does not need to be installed manually.


## Installation

Using [Preference Packs](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Preference_Packs) requires FreeCAD 0.20 or higher.
